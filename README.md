## README.md thing

I keep going around telling people I'm interested in crypto (and I am) but it
seemed a good idea to brush up on the practical application of it. So I figured
I'd roll through the Matasano cryptography challenges and post some solutions
up on my github account. :)

### Warning
This is pretty much a live blog of me using python as an overpowered calculator
for a set of challenges. I'm tweaking the helper functions between challenges
and may ultimately break things between iterations. This code is not fit for
any particular purpose. I'm just documenting my path through some stuff.
